## Technology selection

### Authentication and Authorization:

For authentication and authorization, JSON Web Tokens (JWT) were used by me. JWT is an open standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is widely used for authentication and authorization purposes in web applications. 

### Backend:

For the backend, Node.js was used as the primary technology.
For the web framework, Express.js was chosen. 
For data storage, MongoDB was chosen.
